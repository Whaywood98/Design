1. The Item Controller commits the middle man code smell. There is already a class called Item with all the methods outlined in the
Item Controller class and thus, this class is not needed. The program can be simplified by calling the methods of the Item class 
as needed.

2. All classes extending the Command class are commiting Refused Bequest code smell as many of the Command class's methods
are never used. These methods are obsolete and should be deleted.
